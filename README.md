The classic 1978 game <i>Simon</i> rebuilt using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. It offers a strict mode and speeds up with progression. Remember a sequence of twenty to win!

Play <i>Simon</i> now at: https://collinferry.github.io/simon/ </br>
(Note the instructions before you click anything ðŸ˜Š - you want to click "Power On" to begin playing. This is old school, remember? Also, using sound is highly recommended.)

<strong>At the moment this only runs in Chrome!</strong>

Note: I'm aware of the sound bug when the browser tries to play two sounds concurrently (appears with fast clicking and at the higher speeds).
